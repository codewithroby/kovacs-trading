                Always set an appropriate position size for your trades to
                minimize losses and maximize gains. You should never risk more
                than 5% of your portfolio on each trade.

                Keep your emotions in check while trading. If you are feeling
                stressed or not thinking clearly, you may be at a higher risk of

                trades.

                A common mistake that beginner traders make is trying out too
                many different strategies and using too many indicators on their
                charts before mastering the basics of trading. This approach can
                be overwhelming and ultimately useless.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg py-2">
                Many experienced traders rely solely on candlesticks and volume
                in their trades and are more profitable than those who use 100
                indicators. This approach allows them to focus on what's
                important and avoid getting distracted by what's not.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg py-2">
                Using indicators and different strategies is not bad, but you
                must not skip the fundamentals. Start by getting comfortable
                with support, resistance, volume, and RSI, and only then start
                using advanced techniques in your trading.
